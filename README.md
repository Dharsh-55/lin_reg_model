# lin_reg_model
Using "Pythagorean Expectation" concept, the Win Percentage of a Football club is predicted. The Linear Regression model is used for prediction.

The initial data consists of the 'results of 2036 matches' which took place across the 4 different leagues in English football.
It is then processed to get the data of home and away games, with the win percentage and pythagorean expectation.
A Linear Regression model is built upon this data to predict the 'win percentage' of the team given the value of it's pythagorean expectation.
From this model, it can be concluded that win percentage of a team is directly dependent on its pythagorean expectation value - which in turn is calculated using the goals scored and conceded by the team.
This model can be used to improve the overall team performance and it can be visually represented using a 'power bi' dashboard.
